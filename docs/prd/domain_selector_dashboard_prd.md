# PRD — Domain Selector & Differentiated Dashboard View

<!-- DIRTY_AMENDMENT: [Feedback #1 — DomainSelector relocated from sidebar to SiteHeader as a "Dashboard" nav menu item with domain sub-items (flyout); state lifted to React Context (DomainContext). Approved 2026-06-26] -->
<!-- DIRTY_AMENDMENT: [Feedback #1b — UX refinement: domain selector renders as a header nav item labelled "Dashboard" with a chevron; clicking reveals a sub-menu listing available domains (Wetland Monitoring, Pollution Reports). Not a standalone dropdown button. Approved 2026-06-26] -->
<!-- DIRTY_AMENDMENT: [Feedback #2 — Pollution Reports domain replaces point markers with a choropleth map rendered from sub-country GeoJSON shapefiles. Point markers suppressed on Pollution domain. Click popup shows total incidents + breakdown by type. Approved 2026-06-26] -->

## I. Overview & Goal

### Problem Statement

The public portal dashboard currently renders **pollution reports** (from `Pollution Reporting Form`) and **wetland health sites** (from Monthly Wetland Sampling) combined on the same map and the same list panel with no visual or functional differentiation. The manager has requested these two distinct data domains be clearly separated: users must be able to switch between a **"Pollution Reports" view** and a **"Wetland Monitoring" view** through an explicit domain selector. The list panel below the map must also reflect only the data relevant to the selected domain.

**Feedback #1 Amendment (refined)**: The domain selector has been moved from the left sidebar panel into the **global site header** as a **"Dashboard" navigation menu item**. Clicking "Dashboard" in the header nav opens a flyout sub-menu listing the available domains (🌿 Wetland Monitoring, ⚠ Pollution Reports) with the active domain highlighted. This is a nav-menu pattern — not a standalone button — consistent with how top-level navigation menus expose sub-sections across modern dashboards.

This is the **frontend-first companion** to the Decoupled Analysis Layer initiative, which establishes the `domain` concept at the backend model and API layer. This PRD focuses solely on the **portal UX differentiation** — the domain switcher and differentiated list rendering — without requiring the full backend refactor from the Decoupled Analysis Layer to be complete first.

### Core Metric
- **Before:** Users cannot distinguish wetland health sites from pollution incident markers or their respective list items without prior domain knowledge.
- **After:** 100% of portal users can self-select their view context (Pollution vs. Wetland) and see a correctly filtered map + list within 1 interaction. Domain choice is always accessible from the header nav regardless of sidebar state.

## II. 5W1H Analysis

| Dimension | Details |
|---|---|
| **Who** | Public portal users (NBD Secretariat, NDFs, officials, CSOs, public) and admin/partner users |
| **What** | A **"Dashboard" nav item** in the global site header that, when clicked, reveals a flyout sub-menu with the available domains: "🌿 Wetland Monitoring" and "⚠ Pollution Reports". Selecting a sub-item switches the active domain. |
| **Where** | `frontend/src/components/ui/site-header.tsx` (Dashboard nav item + sub-menu), `frontend/src/app/page.tsx` (map/list logic), `frontend/src/context/domain-context.tsx` (shared state) |
| **When** | Triggered each time a user selects a domain sub-item from the Dashboard menu. Defaults to **"Wetland Monitoring"** on first load. |
| **Why** | A nav-menu pattern is more scalable: if more domains are added in future (Forest, Soil, etc.), they appear as additional sub-items without changing the header layout. It also matches the mental model of "Dashboard is a top-level section with views inside it". |
| **How** | A `DomainContext` (React Context) provides `selectedDomain` and `setSelectedDomain`. `SiteHeader` renders a "Dashboard" nav item with a chevron; clicking toggles a flyout sub-menu panel. Selecting a sub-item calls `setSelectedDomain` and closes the menu. `page.tsx` consumes context to drive map and list rendering. |

## III. User Stories & Flows

### Personas
- **Public Portal Visitor**: Wants to quickly see either "what pollution events happened near me?" OR "how healthy is my local wetland?". Does not want mixed data cluttering the view.
- **NBD / NDF Decision-Maker**: Reviews wetland health scores for policy reports; not interested in raw pollution incidents during that session.
- **CSO Partner**: Cross-references pollution incidents in a basin with wetland health degradation; needs to switch between views fluidly.

### User Flows

#### Flow A — Wetland Monitoring Domain (Default)

```
User opens portal
  -> Header nav shows: "Dashboard" item (active sub-item: "🌿 Wetland Monitoring")
  -> Map shows: Health-class markers (A-E) for monitoring sites
  -> List shows: Site cards with health score, IK-adjusted badge, country, management action
  -> Filter bar: "All / Critical / At risk / Healthy"
```

#### Flow B — Switching to Pollution Report Domain via Dashboard Menu

```
User clicks "Dashboard" in the header nav
  -> Flyout sub-menu appears below the nav item:
     ✓ 🌿 Wetland Monitoring   (active — checkmark shown)
       ⚠ Pollution Reports
  -> User clicks "⚠ Pollution Reports"
  -> Sub-menu closes
  -> Map shows: NO point markers
  -> Map shows: Choropleth polygons (sub-country shapefiles) colour-shaded by incident density
     -> 0 incidents  → slate-grey fill
     -> 1–5          → light amber fill
     -> 6–15         → orange fill
     -> 16+          → deep red fill
  -> Map legend switches to: None / Low / Moderate / High colour buckets
  -> List shows: IncidentCard components with incident type, severity badge, date, description
  -> Filter bar swaps to: Incident Type + Date range
  -> SiteDrawer closes automatically if open
```

#### Flow B2 — Clicking a Choropleth Polygon
```
User clicks a sub-region polygon on the Pollution domain map
  -> Leaflet popup opens (not a drawer)
  -> Popup shows:
     - Sub-region label (GeoJSON feature name / fallback "Sub-region N")
     - "Total Incidents: N"
     - Breakdown by incident type:
       • Oil Spill: 3
       • Chemical Discharge: 2
       • Waste Dumping: 1
       ...
```

#### Flow B3 — Basin Selector Changes (Pollution Domain Active)
```
User changes basin selector (MARA → SIO)
  -> Active shapefiles switch to sio-basin.geojson + sio-siteko-wetland.geojson
  -> Choropleth re-calculates counts against new filtered incident set
  -> Basin boundary outline remains (existing basinGeometry outline)
```

#### Flow C — Switching Back to Wetland

```
User clicks "Dashboard" in the header nav
  -> Sub-menu shows:
       🌿 Wetland Monitoring
     ✓ ⚠ Pollution Reports    (active)
  -> User selects "🌿 Wetland Monitoring"
  -> Sub-menu closes
  -> Map resets to site markers
  -> List re-renders with site cards
  -> Filter bar reverts to: Wetland + Status filters
  -> Basin selection preserved
```

## IV. Scope Guardrails

### Must-Have
1. **Dashboard Nav Item in SiteHeader**: A **"Dashboard"** text nav link is added to `SiteHeader` **between the logo block and the right-side actions**. It has:
   - A label: `Dashboard`
   - A chevron icon that rotates when the sub-menu is open
   - A flyout sub-menu panel that opens on click (or keyboard Enter/Space)
2. **Dashboard Sub-menu**: The flyout panel lists all available domains as sub-items:
   - `🌿 Wetland Monitoring` (default active on every load)
   - `⚠ Pollution Reports`
   - The **active domain sub-item** has a visible checkmark `✓` to the left.
   - Selecting a sub-item: sets the active domain via context + closes the sub-menu.
   - Sub-menu closes on outside click (same `mousedown` pattern as user-menu).
3. **Nav Item Styling**: Matches the site's navigation aesthetic — `text-sm font-medium text-slate-700 hover:text-nbd-primary` with active-domain label shown as a badge or subtle indicator beneath the "Dashboard" label (e.g., `text-[10px] text-slate-400`).
4. **DomainContext**: A React Context (`src/context/domain-context.tsx`) providing `selectedDomain: "wetland" | "pollution"` and `setSelectedDomain`. Default: `"wetland"`.
5. **Sub-menu Scope**: Renders only when `DomainProvider` is in the tree (i.e., on the portal page). On the login page, "Dashboard" nav item is absent.
4. **Map Filtering by Domain**:
   - Wetland active → only health-class site markers shown.
   - Pollution active → **zero point markers**; choropleth layer shown instead (see §IV items 13–20).
5. **Differentiated List Panel**:
   - **Wetland domain**: Existing site cards (unchanged).
   - **Pollution domain**: `IncidentCard` component showing: incident type label, severity badge (colour-coded), date reported, truncated description (max 2 lines).
6. **Filter Adaptation**:
   - Wetland domain: `All / Critical / At risk / Healthy` (current behaviour).
   - Pollution domain: `All / Critical / Elevated` (3 options only).
7. **List Section Header Update**:
   - Wetland: `Monitoring Sites (N)`
   - Pollution: `Pollution Incidents (N)`
8. **Auto-close SiteDrawer / IncidentDrawer**:
   - Switching to Pollution domain calls `setSelectedSite(null)`.
   - Switching to Wetland domain calls `setSelectedIncident(null)`.
9. **Default Domain**: `"wetland"` on every page load. No persistence to `localStorage`.
10. **IncidentDrawer on Card Click**:
    - Clicking an `IncidentCard` (or clicking an incident map marker) opens an `IncidentDrawer` displaying full incident details.
11. **Photo Display**:
    - If a pollution incident contains image attachments (answers of type `image`, `signature`, or `attachment`), display the photo(s) inline in the `IncidentDrawer` using secure, backend-generated read URLs.
12. **Header Dropdown Close**: Closes on outside click (same pattern as user-menu dropdown in `SiteHeader`).

13. **No Point Markers on Pollution Domain**: The `markers` array passed to `MapViewer` must be `[]` (empty) when `selectedDomain === "pollution"`.
14. **Choropleth Layer in MapViewer**: `MapViewer` receives a new optional prop `choroplethLayers?: ChoroplethFeature[]` containing enriched GeoJSON features with pre-computed incident counts.
15. **Static GeoJSON Shapefiles** — imported as static JSON (Next.js native support), selected by active basin:

    | `selectedBasin` | Shapefiles |
    |---|---|
    | `MARA` | `mara-basin.geojson` + `mara-wetland.geojson` |
    | `SIO` (or any other) | `sio-basin.geojson` + `sio-siteko-wetland.geojson` |

    Source files: `backend/app/seeds/spatial/`

16. **Point-in-Polygon Aggregation**: Use `@turf/boolean-point-in-polygon` to test each incident's `geo.coordinates` against each shapefile Feature polygon. Produce `incidentCount` + `incidentBreakdown: Record<string, number>` per feature.
17. **Colour Scale**:

    | Count | Fill Colour | Label |
    |---|---|---|
    | 0 | `#f1f5f9` (slate-100) | None |
    | 1–5 | `#fef3c7` (amber-100) | Low |
    | 6–15 | `#f97316` (orange-500) | Moderate |
    | 16+ | `#dc2626` (red-600) | High |

18. **Choropleth Click Popup** (Leaflet popup — not a drawer): Sub-region label + total count + per-type breakdown table (incident type extracted from `answers`, `question_id === 2` / `name === "incident_type"`).
19. **Hover Highlight**: On `mouseover`, polygon stroke weight increases to `3px` for clear affordance.
20. **Domain-Aware Map Legend**: `MapLegend` shows colour buckets (None / Low / Moderate / High) when Pollution domain is active; existing health-class legend when Wetland domain is active.
21. **Basin Boundary Outline Preserved**: Existing `basinGeometry` teal outline remains visible underneath the choropleth layer.

### Nice-to-Have (Deferred to future sprint)
- URL query param persistence (`?domain=pollution`) for shareability.
- Count badges on each domain option in the dropdown.
- Animated transition between domain views.
- Drill-down: clicking a choropleth polygon filters the sidebar incident list to that sub-region only.
- Backend-computed spatial aggregation endpoint for performance at scale.

### Out of Scope
- Full backend `domain` column migration (Decoupled Analysis Layer scope).
- Creating new monitoring domains (Forest, Soil, etc.).
- Admin interface changes.
- Any structural change to `SiteDrawer` itself.
- `localStorage` domain persistence.
- Keeping the pill-tab `DomainSelector` in the sidebar (removed).
- Displaying point markers alongside choropleth on Pollution domain.
- Server-side GeoJSON storage or PostGIS spatial queries.
- Adding new shapefiles beyond the 4 already in the repo.

### New Files

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `src/context/domain-context.tsx` | React Context: `DomainProvider`, `useDomain` hook, default `"wetland"` |
| `src/lib/types.ts` (or extend existing) | `ChoroplethFeature` type — GeoJSON Feature + `incidentCount: number` + `incidentBreakdown: Record<string, number>` + `displayName: string` |

### New Components

| Component | File | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DomainSelector` (original) | `src/components/ui/domain-selector.tsx` | Kept but no longer rendered on portal page; may be reused elsewhere |
| `IncidentCard` | `src/components/ui/incident-card.tsx` | Card displaying a single pollution incident in the list |

### New Dependency

| Package | Purpose | Install |
|---|---|---|
| `@turf/boolean-point-in-polygon` | Point-in-polygon spatial test | `./dc.sh exec frontend yarn add @turf/boolean-point-in-polygon` |

### Modified Files

| File | Change Summary |
|---|---|
| `src/app/page.tsx` | Wrap `<main>` with `<DomainProvider>`; replace local `selectedDomain` state with `useDomain()`; remove `<DomainSelector>` from sidebar; add `choroplethLayers` useMemo; pass `markers={[]}` on Pollution domain |
| `src/components/ui/site-header.tsx` | Import `useDomain`; add `domainDropdownOpen` state + outside-click ref; render custom styled domain dropdown between logo and right actions |

## VI. Acceptance Criteria

### User Acceptance Criteria (UAC)

- **UAC-1 (Default State)**: Given a user opens the portal, "Wetland Monitoring" domain is active by default; header dropdown shows "🌿 Wetland Monitoring"; map shows health-class site markers; list shows site cards.
- **UAC-2 (Domain Switch via Header)**: Given "Wetland Monitoring" is active, when the user opens the header dropdown and selects "Pollution Reports", then: map shows only incident markers; list header changes to "Pollution Incidents (N)"; list renders `IncidentCard` components.
- **UAC-3 (Filter Adaptation)**: In "Pollution Reports" domain, filter labels show only "All / Critical / Elevated" and filter the incident list accordingly.
- **UAC-4 (Basin Selector Persists)**: Basin selection is preserved across domain switches.
- **UAC-5 (Empty States)**:
  - No incidents: "No pollution incidents reported in this basin."
  - No sites: Existing "No active stations matching filters."
- **UAC-6 (SiteDrawer Auto-close)**: Switching to the Pollution domain closes any open SiteDrawer.
- **UAC-7 (Incident Card Legibility)**: Each `IncidentCard` displays: incident type, severity badge, date reported, description (max 2 lines).
- **UAC-H1 (Dashboard Nav Item Visible)**: A "Dashboard" nav item is visible in the site header at all times on the portal page — including when the sidebar is collapsed on mobile.
- **UAC-H2 (Login Page Clean)**: No "Dashboard" nav item is rendered on `http://localhost:3000/login`.
- **UAC-H3 (Sub-menu Opens/Closes)**: Clicking "Dashboard" opens the flyout sub-menu; clicking outside closes it without changing the domain.
- **UAC-H4 (Active Checkmark)**: The currently active domain sub-item shows a checkmark `✓` in the sub-menu.
- **UAC-H5 (Sub-item Click Changes Domain)**: Clicking a domain sub-item sets `selectedDomain` via context and closes the sub-menu.
- **UAC-H6 (Active Domain Label)**: The "Dashboard" nav item shows a subtle indicator of the active domain (e.g., a small badge or sub-label below "Dashboard") so the user knows the current view without opening the menu.
- **UAC-C1 (No Markers — Pollution)**: Given `selectedDomain === "pollution"`, zero point markers are rendered on the map.
- **UAC-C2 (Choropleth Visible)**: Given Pollution domain is active, colour-shaded polygons covering the active basin's sub-regions appear within 1 second of domain switch.
- **UAC-C3 (Colour Scale)**: A polygon with 0 incidents is slate-grey; 1–5 is amber; 6–15 is orange; 16+ is red.
- **UAC-C4 (Click Popup)**: Clicking a polygon opens a Leaflet popup showing total incident count and per-type breakdown.
- **UAC-C5 (Basin Switch — Choropleth)**: Switching basin updates the polygons and recomputes counts against the new shapefile set.
- **UAC-C6 (Domain Switch to Wetland)**: Switching to Wetland domain removes the choropleth and restores site markers.
- **UAC-C7 (Choropleth Legend)**: When Pollution domain is active, the legend shows None / Low / Moderate / High colour buckets.
- **UAC-C8 (Hover Effect)**: Hovering a polygon increases border weight for clear interactive affordance.

### Technical Acceptance Criteria (TAC)

- **TAC-1**: `selectedDomain` typed as `"wetland" | "pollution"` union literal in context; no `string` or `any` introduced.
- **TAC-2**: `mapMarkers` wrapped in `useMemo` depending on `[selectedDomain, filteredSites, filteredIncidents, t]`.
- **TAC-3**: `IncidentCard` has typed props; no implicit page-level dependencies.
- **TAC-4**: `SiteDrawer` is only opened when `selectedDomain === "wetland"`.
- **TAC-5**: All existing `__tests__/` continue to pass; new tests added for `DomainContext` and updated `SiteHeader` dropdown behaviour.
- **TAC-H1**: `DomainProvider` wraps only the portal page tree, not the global `layout.tsx` (prevents context leaking into admin/login pages).
- **TAC-H2**: `useDomain` throws a descriptive error when called outside `DomainProvider` (safe guard for future page additions).
- **TAC-H3**: Dashboard sub-menu ref closes on `mousedown` outside — identical pattern to existing user-menu in `SiteHeader`.
- **TAC-H4**: `SiteHeader` detects the presence of `DomainContext` via a try/catch or optional context — renders "Dashboard" nav item only when context is available.
- **TAC-C1**: `choroplethLayers` typed as `ChoroplethFeature[]`; each element extends GeoJSON `Feature` with `incidentCount: number`, `incidentBreakdown: Record<string, number>`, `displayName: string`.
- **TAC-C2**: `choroplethLayers` computation wrapped in `useMemo([filteredIncidents, selectedBasin, selectedDomain])`.
- **TAC-C3**: GeoJSON files imported as static JSON — no runtime HTTP fetch.
- **TAC-C4**: `@turf/boolean-point-in-polygon` used for point-in-polygon test — no custom geometry code.
- **TAC-C5**: Choropleth layer uses Leaflet's `onEachFeature` callback for hover and click — no custom D3 or canvas rendering.

## VII. Edge Cases & Errors

| Case | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| No incidents in basin | Pollution list: "No pollution incidents reported in this basin."; all choropleth polygons render in neutral grey |
| No sites in basin | Wetland list: existing "No active stations matching filters." |
| Incident with missing geo | Skipped from point-in-polygon test; map does not crash |
| Incident `geo.coordinates` is `[0,0]` | Treated as invalid; falls outside all polygons; counted as unattributed; not rendered |
| Domain switched while SiteDrawer open | Drawer closes (`setSelectedSite(null)`) |
| Incident with missing `answers` array | Fallback: type = "Pollution Report", severity = "Moderate" |
| `useDomain` called outside `DomainProvider` | Throws `Error: useDomain must be used within a DomainProvider` |
| GeoJSON feature has no `name` property | Fallback label: "Sub-region N" (feature index) |
| `selectedBasin` is not MARA or SIO | Default to SIO shapefiles; no crash |

---

## VIII. Rollout & Rollback Plan

### Rollout
- Deploy to staging; QA smoke test for both domains via header dropdown.
- Feature is purely additive; default is "Wetland Monitoring" — zero breaking changes.
- No database migration, no API contract change.
- Login page unaffected (not wrapped by `DomainProvider`).

### Rollback
- Revert `site-header.tsx` to pre-feature commit; remove `DomainContext` and `DomainProvider` from `page.tsx`; restore `<DomainSelector>` to sidebar.

| **Grand Total (All Feedbacks)** | | **~19.75 hours / ~3 Story Points** |

### Assumptions
- `GET /api/v1/submissions?status=APPROVED` already returns incidents filtered to `form_name === "Pollution Reporting Form"` on the frontend.
- `mapMarkers` already supports `type: "site"` and `type: "incident"` — domain filtering is the only change.
- Decoupled Analysis Layer DB migration is **not** a prerequisite. Architecture is forward-compatible with that future migration.
- `DomainProvider` wraps only the portal `page.tsx` return; `layout.tsx` is untouched.

## X. GeoJSON Shapefile Reference

| File | Basin | Geometry Type | Key Properties |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mara-basin.geojson` | MARA | `FeatureCollection` (1 Feature, MultiPolygon) | `HYBAS_ID`, `SUB_AREA`, `PFAF_ID` |
| `mara-wetland.geojson` | MARA | `FeatureCollection` (1 Feature, Polygon) | `cluster`, `count`, `area` |
| `sio-basin.geojson` | SIO | `FeatureCollection` (1 Feature, MultiPolygon) | `FID` |
| `sio-siteko-wetland.geojson` | SIO | `FeatureCollection` (multi-Feature, MultiPolygon) | complex geometry, no named properties |

> **Display Name Strategy**: `feature.properties.name ?? feature.properties.HYBAS_ID ?? "Sub-region ${index + 1}"`

---

## XI. SDD Alignment Check

| SDD Feature (§4.5) | This PRD |
|---|---|
| "Pollution incident map" | Pollution domain: choropleth of incident density per sub-region; zero point markers |
| "Wetland health scores" | Wetland domain shows only health site markers + score list |
| "Search and Filter" (§4.5.3) | Domain-aware filter labels; basin selector persists |
| "Mobile-friendly layout" | DomainSelector in header is always accessible; sidebar collapse does not hide domain choice |
